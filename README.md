# React + TypeScript + Vite + Material UI + MUI Datagrid

This project is intended to be a Proof of Concept of how we can share data between two or more
datagrids.

## Tech

 - React
 - Mui
 - Axios
 - TanStack react query

### Why I'm using Datagrid Premium?

I'm only testing some of the premium features MUI team provide us, I'm not breaking any rules
here because I'm doing this project just to study the MUI's Datagrid behaviour after a fetch
from axios.

At [the second example of their website](https://mui.com/legal/mui-x-eula#evaluation-trial-licenses)
we are allowed to make theses testings without a license.
